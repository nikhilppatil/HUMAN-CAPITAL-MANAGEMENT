**1. Current Business Overview**



Finding suitable rooms or flats in Metro Cities is a major challenge for bachelors. Most available options are either not listed clearly, require third-party brokers, or lack trust and transparency. Bachelors often face delays, rejections, or are overcharged due to the absence of a streamlined platform.



Currently, the rental market relies heavily on brokers and third-party vendors, which introduces inefficiencies, inflated costs, and lack of direct communication between owners and tenants.

**2. Key Challenges and Gaps**





1. **Difficult and Time-Consuming Search**
   Bachelors struggle to find affordable, verified accommodation in preferred areas due to outdated listings, hidden charges, and lack of real-time availability.
2. **Lack of Direct Communication**
   There’s no direct, transparent channel connecting bachelors with property owners, forcing reliance on brokers who add costs and create trust issues.
3. **No Easy Digital Solution**

   Existing platforms don’t specifically cater to bachelors’ unique needs, resulting in a confusing and inefficient rental experience.

**3. Proposed Digital Solutions**



* To address these challenges, a dedicated web and mobile platform should be developed, featuring:



* Verified listings exclusively by property owners, eliminating brokers and third parties.



* Advanced search filters tailored for bachelor-friendly housing (1RK, 1BHK, PG, shared flats).



* Real-time availability updates to ensure accuracy.



* Integrated communication tools such as in-app chat and call features to connect owners and tenants directly.



* Map-based search to explore listings geographically and intuitively.



* User reviews and rating systems for both owners and renters to build trust and transparency.



* Support for short-term, long-term, and shared accommodations to accommodate diverse needs.



* Secure booking and confirmation workflows within the app.
