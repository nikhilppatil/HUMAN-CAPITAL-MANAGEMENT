Employee Data Migration and System Configuration Process



Employee Data Migration via ETL Process

In this initial phase, we receive the master data from the old system. We then perform the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to clean, format, and migrate the data into the new legacy system. This includes all relevant employee details required for payroll and leave management.



System Configuration for Payroll and Leave

After successfully migrating the data, we proceed with configuring the system:



Payroll Setup: Configuration of pay scales, pay heads, deduction rules, and statutory components such as PF (Provident Fund) calculations.



Employee Assignment: Each employee is mapped to the appropriate payroll structure or slab based on their designation and salary group.



Leave Setup: Definition of leave types, eligibility criteria, accrual policies, and holiday calendars.



Client Handover and Demonstration

Once the payroll and leave modules are fully configured, we provide the configuration details to the client. A demo session is conducted to walk the client through the implementation, showcasing how the system handles payroll processing and leave management based on the configured rules
