**Waterfall Methodology**



collection of requirements > analysis > understanding tech requirements > development > testing > product launch live > support



Sequential approach: Each phase must be completed before the next begins.



Best for: Projects with clear, fixed requirements.

**Agile Methodologies**



Agile is a flexible, iterative approach to software development and project management that focuses on delivering small, workable pieces of software frequently, with constant collaboration and adaptation.



**Key Principles of Agile:**



1. Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)
2. Collaborate closely with customers and stakeholders
3. Respond to change over following a fixed plan
4. Self-organizing, cross-functional teams
5. Continuous improvement through regular feedback



**Popular Agile Frameworks:**



1. **Scrum:** Most widely used; works in fixed-length iterations called sprints.
2. **Kanban:** Visualizes workflow on a board, focuses on continuous flow without fixed iterations.
3. **XP (Extreme Programming):** Emphasizes engineering best practices like test-driven development.

**How To Gather Requirements | Agile Methodology**



1\. Interviews : Structured conversations with stakeholders to gather detailed, firsthand requirements.

&nbsp;

2\. JAD: Joint Application Development : Facilitated workshops involving users and developers to collaboratively define system requirements.



3\. Interface Analysis : Examines how the system interacts with external systems or users to identify interface requirements.



4\. Observation : Involves watching users perform tasks to understand existing processes and identify hidden requirements.



5\. Brainstorming : Group technique to generate a wide range of ideas and potential solutions quickly.



6\. Surveys : Collects structured feedback from a large audience to quantify needs and preferences.



7\. Review Past Documents: Analyzes existing documentation to extract relevant information and historical requirements.

**How to Analyze Requirements (Short Summary)**



Use Case Diagrams: Show user interactions with the system.



Workflow Diagrams: Visualize business processes (AS-IS \& TO-BE).



Data Flow Diagrams: Track how data moves through the system.



Sequence Diagrams: Show interaction flow between components over time.



User Stories: Describe features from the end-user's perspective.
